/* --Variables--
 * In PHP, variables are denoted by a dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name. 
 
 * When naming variables in PHP, there are a few rules to follow:
    Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
    Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    Variable names are case-sensitive ($name and $Name are different variables).

--Datatype--

 * PHP is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable when you create it.
 * PHP automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.
 * PHP supports several basic data types, including integers, floats (floating-point numbers), strings, booleans, and null.
