/* Associative arrays store data as key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.

 * In an associative array, each key must be unique. If you attempt to insert a duplicate key, 
   it typically results in updating the existing key-value pair with the new value.

 * Associative arrays can store data of different types, eg: integers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.
